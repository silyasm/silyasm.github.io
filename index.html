        <h3><img src="fonts/staff-snake-solid.svg" alt="Mentorship Icon" class="icon"> Mentorship Program</h3>
          <p>Our mentorship program follows a structured hierarchy, connecting undergraduates with medical students, medical students with residents, and residents with doctors. While priority is given to connections within this hierarchy, participants are encouraged to explore mentorship opportunities outside of it if they find a suitable match. This flexible approach ensures that individuals receive tailored guidance while allowing for connections that best serve their needs and aspirations.
